# Docker Development Environment with Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits

## Introduction

This guide outlines the steps to set up a Docker development environment that enforces Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits. The environment will integrate various plugins and tools, along with the ChatGPT API, to ensure a standardized and efficient development workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed on your MacBook Air M2
- Visual Studio Code installed
- Git installed

## Step 1: Initialize Docker Dev Environment

1. **Navigate to your project directory.**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2. **Create a Dockerfile for your development environment.**
    ```bash
    touch Dockerfile
    ```
    Add the following content to the Dockerfile:
    ```Dockerfile
    # Base image
    FROM node:14

    # Working directory
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    # Install dependencies
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install

    # Copy project files
    COPY . .
    ```

3. **Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file.**
    ```bash
    touch docker-compose.yaml
    ```
    Add the following content to `docker-compose.yaml`:
    ```yaml
    version: "3.7"
    services:
      app:
        build:
          context: .
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
    ```

## Step 4: Publish Docker Image to Docker Hub

1. **Log in to Docker Hub.**
    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

2. **Tag the Docker image.**
    ```bash
    docker tag local-image-name:tagname new-repo-name:tagname
    ```

3. **Push the Docker image.**
    ```bash
    docker push new-repo-name:tagname
    ```
